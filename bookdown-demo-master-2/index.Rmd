# Prerequisites

This is to understand how MASH performs in the setting of uncorrelated errors, where we assume the $$E \sim N (0,V)$$ and $V$ is not diagonal.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter.
